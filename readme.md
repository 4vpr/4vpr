Iâ€™m an indie game developer currently working on **Dansu**, a rhythm game built with Godot 4.3.  
My main focus is on game programming, optimization, and experimenting with backend systems.  

---

## Projects
### Dansu (Rhythm Game)
- Implemented beatmap parsing, timing/judgment system, and difficulty calculation algorithm
- Built a multithreaded beatmap loading system
- Developing an integrated in-game beatmap editor
- Planning a beatmap sharing server using Flask
- Applied performance optimizations (FPS limiting, V-Sync control, caching)

---

## Current Focus
- Advanced difficulty rating system (note density, Input per second, regression-based tuning)  
- Backend for beatmap sharing and ranking (Flask-based)  
- Efficient UI/UX and multithreaded optimizations
